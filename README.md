# PCR-Software
This Software is created by Swivano Agmal during IoT-PCR reasearch Project in Research Center for Physics-LIPI

## Definition
PCR is Polymerease Chain Reaction which realted with multiplication of DNA. We use thermal cycler as a machine to do this reaction. 

## Based On LIPI Research Project to attain Covid19 Issues

This software is developed during Covid 19 Lipi resarch project. PCR is also used to test Sars-Cov 2 Infection using RNA mucltiplication test. Generally, the medical officers use the dropplet which obtained by the suspicious person to be tested on this machines. If there is multiplication of RNA SARSCOV2 so it shows the person is infected by SARS COV 2 or Wuhan Coronavirus 2019. 

The machines it self is controlled by the software. This software is integrated with electronics system that allowed the temperature changing.
